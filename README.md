2). [Classification of US Congressional Speech Data][ref]
2740 US Congressional debates speech text was considered and two types of classification 
carried out. 
i) *Binary Classification: Finding if the debate was made in "For" or "Against" the bill.
    Algorithm used Graph Clustering (Spectral) followed by K-means
ii) *Multi-class Classification: Clustering the 2740 debates into 38 topics on which discussion happened. 
    Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Non Negative Matrix Factorization were considered. However Graph clustering
    again had better results.
